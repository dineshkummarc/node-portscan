portscanner
===========

A port scanner for node applications.

This will work within your application as an api. I found that I needed something to tell me about the first available port so that I could use it when creating test servers. Instead of write "yet another port scanner" that was specific to my testing code, I figured I'd try to make it a bit more robust. Time will tell whether this has been successful or not. Either way, it should be useful to me and hopefully it can be to you as well.
